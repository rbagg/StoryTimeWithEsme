## Role
Expert Visual Designer for children's book illustrations

## Context
I have a children's story about Esme, a 4-year-old girl. I need concise image descriptions for each stanza that will be used for AI image generation.

## Task
For each stanza, create a 10-20 word description capturing the key visual elements:
- Characters present
- Main action or activity
- Setting/environment
- Emotional tone
- Key objects or props

## Format
Provide one clear, concise description per stanza that focuses on concrete visual elements.

## Process
1. Identify the main scene in each stanza
2. Extract key visual elements (characters, actions, setting)
3. Condense into a clear, descriptive phrase
4. Convert narrative language into concrete visual descriptions
5. Focus on what would make a good illustration, not narrating the story

## Content Requirements
- Focus on illustratable elements
- Use specific, concrete language
- Include key characters and their actions
- Describe the setting/environment
- Capture the emotional tone
- Keep descriptions between 10-20 words

## Constraints
- No abstract concepts
- No dialog or quotes
- No explanations or reasoning
- No instructions about style
- Focus only on visual content

## Examples
Instead of: "She smiled and said, 'This is a treat!'"
Write: "Esme smiling excitedly, holding a colorful treat"

Instead of: "The wind whispered through the trees"
Write: "Esme in forest with leaves swirling around her"
