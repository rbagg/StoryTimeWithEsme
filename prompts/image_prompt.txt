## Main Character - Esme
{{esme_description}}
CRITICAL: Esme must maintain exact consistency - same face, hair, clothing, and proportions in every image.

## Other Characters (if present)
- **Parents/Adults**: Clearly different from Esme - adult height, mature faces, different hair colors/styles
- **Other Children**: Visibly different from Esme - different hair colors (blonde, black, red), different clothing styles, different facial features
- **Animals**: Stylized with large kawaii eyes, but each species should be distinct
- **Background People**: Varied appearances, clearly not the main character

## Character Distinction Guidelines
- **Esme**: Always the focal point with consistent appearance
- **Dad**: Tall adult man, different hair color from Esme, kind face
- **Mum/Mom**: Adult woman, different hair style from Esme, warm expression
- **Other Kids**: Clearly different - if Esme has curly brown hair, give others straight blonde, black braids, red pigtails, etc.
- **Animals**: Each species has distinct characteristics while maintaining cute style

## Enhanced Visual Style Guidelines
- **Cinematic Composition**: Use dramatic camera angles - bird's eye views, dynamic close-ups, wide establishing shots, or over-the-shoulder perspectives
- **Rule of Thirds**: Position Esme and key elements along compositional grid lines for visual impact
- **Dynamic Poses**: Show Esme in mid-action with natural, expressive body language and clear emotional expression
- **Depth & Layers**: Create rich foreground, midground, and background elements with atmospheric perspective
- **Lighting Drama**: Use cinematic lighting - golden hour, rim lighting, dramatic shadows, or magical ambient glow
- **Color Psychology**: Choose vibrant, emotionally resonant colors that match the scene's mood and energy
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Fill backgrounds with rich details that support and enhance the narrative moment

## Advanced Visual Elements
- **Motion & Energy**: Include visual motion cues - flowing hair, clothing in motion, water splashes, floating particles
- **Scale & Perspective**: Use size relationships to create wonder - show Esme small against large playground equipment or vast landscapes
- **Emotional Resonance**: Capture the peak emotional moment of each scene through Esme's expression and posture
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Add depth with mist, sparkles, sunbeams, shadows, or magical elements
- **Texture Variety**: Mix smooth and textured surfaces - rough wood, smooth water, soft fabric, gleaming metal
- **Leading Lines**: Use environmental elements (paths, railings, structures) to guide the eye to Esme

## Scene-Specific Enhancements
- **Playground scenes**: Show equipment from dramatic low angles, capture the thrill and scale
- **Home scenes**: Create cozy, warm lighting with rich interior details and comfortable spaces
- **Pool scenes**: Dynamic water effects, splash patterns, underwater views, crystal-clear reflections
- **Outdoor scenes**: Expansive skies, natural lighting changes, environmental movement (wind, birds)
- **Action scenes**: Freeze dramatic moments mid-motion with clear energy and momentum

## Character Animation Readiness
- **Clear Subject Separation**: Compose Esme distinctly from background for clean animation masking
- **Consistent Lighting**: Establish clear light sources that can be maintained in animation
- **Expressive Details**: Emphasize facial expressions, hand gestures, and body language for animation enhancement
- **Environmental Anchors**: Include stable background elements that provide context during animation

## Technical Excellence Parameters
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Make Esme the clear focal point while supporting elements enhance the story
- **Color Harmony**: Use cohesive color palettes with strategic accent colors for visual pop
- **Contrast Management**: Balance high contrast for drama with sufficient detail in all areas
- **Edge Definition**: Clear, clean edges around character and important elements for animation compatibility
- **Character Consistency**: {% if is_reference == "YES" %}THIS REFERENCE IMAGE WILL DEFINE ESME'S APPEARANCE FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT IMAGES{% else %}Maintain exact character consistency with reference image while allowing dynamic poses and expressions{% endif %}

## Specific Scene Focus
- **Main Action**: {{image_description}}
- **Emotional Context**: Capture Esme's feelings and reactions authentically
- **Story Moment**: Show the most visually compelling and narratively important part of this scene
- **Environmental Mood**: Let the setting reflect and amplify the emotional tone

## Enhanced Negative Prompts
- Static, boring poses or expressions
- Flat, even lighting without drama or interest
- Empty, lifeless backgrounds lacking detail
- Poor composition with centered, predictable framing
- Muddy colors or lack of visual contrast
- Distorted anatomy, extra limbs, or facial inconsistencies
- Adult proportions on child character
- All characters looking identical or similar
- Overly realistic animals (maintain stylized, kawaii appearance)
- Dark, scary, or inappropriate imagery
- Blurry details or lack of crisp definition
- Generic stock photo appearance
- Characters that could be confused with Esme
