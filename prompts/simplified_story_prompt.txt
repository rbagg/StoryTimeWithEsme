## Role
Early Childhood Reading Specialist with expertise in emergent literacy

## Context
I have a children's story that I want to simplify for very early readers (ages 2-4) who are just learning to read.

## Task
Create a simplified version of this story with these specific guidelines:
1. Keep the same number of stanzas/sections as the original
2. Reduce each stanza to 2-4 VERY simple sentences
3. Use primarily sight words and simple phonetic words (CVC pattern words like cat, dog, run)
4. Keep sentences short (3-5 words each)
5. Focus on basic sentence structures (e.g., "Esme sees a cat." "The cat is big.")
6. Include some word repetition to build confidence
7. Each stanza MUST match the same scene/action as the original but with much simpler language

## Format
- Keep the same stanza structure as the original
- Use simple sentences with 3-5 words each
- Maintain a blank line between stanzas
- Focus on the same scenes and progression as the original story

## Process
1. Analyze each stanza of the original story
2. Identify the core action or concept in each stanza
3. Rewrite using only basic sight words and simple phonetic patterns
4. Maintain the story's progression and key elements
5. Verify that vocabulary is appropriate for emerging readers

## Content Requirements
- Use primarily these sight words:
  a, and, at, can, come, do, for, get, go, has, he, her, him, his, I, in, is, it, like, look, 
  me, my, no, on, play, said, see, she, the, this, to, up, was, we, with, yes, you
- Use simple phonetic patterns (CVC words):
  cat, dog, run, sit, hat, big, red, sun, fun, hot, pot, not, get, let, wet, sad, mad, bad
- Short 3-5 word sentences
- Basic sentence structures (subject-verb-object)
- No complex vocabulary or idioms

## Constraints
- No sentences longer than 5 words
- No complex vocabulary (only common sight words and simple phonetic words)
- No complex grammatical structures
- No figurative language or idioms
- No abstract concepts without concrete representation
