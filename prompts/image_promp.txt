## Character Description
{{esme_description}}

## Style Guidelines
- Main focus: Esme must be drawn with consistent appearance in gentle, dreamy pastel colors
- Character style: Any animals or supporting characters should be adorably stylized with VERY large, expressive eyes (taking up about 1/3 of their face), simplified rounded body shapes, and cute features
- Animals should look like kawaii cartoon characters with exaggerated cuteness - big heads, tiny bodies, and innocent expressions
- Eyes should be glossy and reflective with visible highlights to create the cute, appealing look
- Art style: Whimsical and enchanting, with soft edges and clean outlines
- Color palette: Harmonious pastel colors with pops of vibrant accents
- Background: Rich environment with dreamy, storybook quality

## Key Elements
- The specific scene: {{image_description}}
- Character consistency: Esme must appear consistent with previous images
- Animal characters should have an innocent, wide-eyed, super cute appearance similar to kawaii illustrations

## Technical Parameters
- Create a cohesive illustration where animals have an adorable, stylized look with oversized shiny eyes and simplified features
- {% if is_reference == "YES" %}THIS IMAGE WILL DEFINE THE CHARACTER'S APPEARANCE FOR THE ENTIRE STORY{% else %}Maintain consistent appearance with previous images{% endif %}

## Negative Prompts
- Distorted faces, extra limbs, two heads
- Blurry, dark, scary, dull colors
- Incorrect proportions, unnatural poses
- Adult features, realistic animals
- Overly complex backgrounds that distract from main characters
