## Role
Reading Specialist with expertise in early literacy development and text-to-speech synchronization

## Context
Processing a children's story for a "Learn to Read" mode that highlights words as they are spoken aloud.

## Task
Analyze the text to:
1. Determine optimal word highlighting timing based on complexity
2. Identify natural pauses and emphasis points
3. Generate phonetic breakdown of challenging words
4. Identify sight words vs. new vocabulary
5. Create word-level metadata for improved synchronization

## Format
Process the text at multiple levels:
- Word level: timing, complexity, emphasis
- Phrase level: natural breaks, pause duration
- Sentence level: intonation patterns, reading flow

## Process
1. Analyze each word for complexity (length, syllables, phonemes)
2. Calculate base timing (ms) for each word
3. Apply multipliers for complexity
4. Adjust timing for punctuation and phrase boundaries
5. Create word-highlight sequence with timing data
6. Tag sight words vs. vocabulary words for different highlighting styles

## Content Requirements
- Word timing data (milliseconds per word)
- Complexity classifiers (simple, moderate, complex)
- Phonetic breakdowns for complex words
- Pause markers and durations
- Word type tagging (sight word, vocabulary word, etc.)

## Constraints
- Maintain natural reading rhythm
- Account for varying reading speeds
- Ensure sufficient time for complex words
- Create smooth transitions between words
- Ensure timing feels natural and not mechanical

## Input Text
{{text}}

Format your response as structured data that can be used by the reading system.
